title: Howto uninstall the Cisco VPN Client for Mac OS X
---
For those of you unfortunate enough to need this, here's a little gem I found:

bq. Whatever. There is no uninstaller, so you need to use to following command from the terminal:
<code>$ sudo /usr/local/bin/vpn_uninstall</code>
You are prompted to remove all profiles and certificates.
