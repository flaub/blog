title: Introducing Sensei

I'm posting an alpha release of Sensei to get some feedback from anyone who wants to try it out.

You can download "Sensei here":/files/Sensei-alpha3.7z. Right now I've only got a package for Mac OS X. When I get time I'll work on getting a package for Windows and Linux created and posted.
