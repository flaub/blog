This is a handy little tool for developers that like to use Visual Studio as their primary code editor. Just give the tool the directories you'd like it to inspect and the name of the output project file, and viola, a .vcproj file is generated that can now be opened by Visual Studio. This is especially useful for external 3rd-party code such as boost, or even the linux kernel. The advantage of using Visual Studio as a simple code browser is that it will allow you to quickly move between files and it does a pretty good job of parsing the code so that the Class Viewer and other intellisense features actually work.

Now I just need to find a place to post it... and that would be on "box.net":http://box.net, pretty cool, up to 1GB of storage for free.

This is a .NET application, so you'll probably need the .NET Framework 2.0+ installed.
