title: Introducing DotWeb
---

I'm starting this new year by announcing a new project web site for DotWeb.

"http://www.dotweb-toolkit.com":http://www.dotweb-toolkit.com

I've mentioned before my interest in an "assemblier for the web":/2009/01/26/treating-javascript-like-assembly.html. DotWeb is really just a clone of "GWT":http://code.google.com/webtoolkit.
