#################################################

For those of you unfortunate enough to need this, here's a little gem I found:

  Whatever. There is no uninstaller, so you need to use to following command
  from the terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ sudo /usr/local/bin/vpn_uninstall

..

  You are prompted to remove all profiles and certificates.
