Introducing Sensei
##################

I'm posting an alpha release of Sensei to get some feedback from anyone who
wants to try it out.

You can download `Sensei here`_. Right now I've only got a package for Mac OS X.
When I get time I'll work on getting a package for Windows and Linux created and
posted.

Totally unrelated
