OpenSSL.NET version 0.4 released
################################

OpenSSL.NET - Managed wrapper for the OpenSSL toolkit
-----------------------------------------------------

http://openssl-net.sourceforge.net

I'm pleased to announce the release of version 0.4 of OpenSSL.NET.

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

A managed OpenSSL wrapper written in C# for the 2.0 .NET Framework that exposes
both the Crypto API and the SSL API. This a must for .NET developers that need
crypto but don't want to use Microsoft's SSPI. This wrapper is based on version
0.9.8k of ``libeay32.dll`` and ``ssleay32.dll``.

Download
~~~~~~~~

You can download a pre-built binary for win32 using the following link:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/openssl-net/files/openssl-net/0.4/openssl.net-0.4-win32.zip/download

In addition, source code is available via git under the New BSD License:

``git://openssl-net.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/openssl-net/openssl-net``

Preliminary support for mono has been added and has been tested on debian x64
and Mac OS X 10.5.

Thanks
~~~~~~

A big thanks goes out to Ben Henderson for contributing the wrapper for the SSL
library.
